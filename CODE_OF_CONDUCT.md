# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be decent. Don't be a jerk. We're here to build a useful tool, not to argue.

## The Slightly Longer Version

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Assume good intent — most misunderstandings aren't malicious
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Keep feedback about the code, not the person
- If someone asks you to stop, stop

## Enforcement

If someone is being a problem, open an issue or email the maintainer. We'll handle it.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces — issues, PRs, discussions, and any related communication channels.
